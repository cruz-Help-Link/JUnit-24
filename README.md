# Unit Testing Repository

## Overview

This repository contains unit tests for the [Project Name]. It demonstrates best practices for unit testing using [JUnit/EasyMock/Mockito/Other Testing Frameworks], ensuring that the code behaves as expected and adheres to the desired quality standards.

## Project Structure

- **src/main/java**: Contains the main application code.
- **src/test/java**: Contains the unit tests for the application.
- **build.gradle** or **pom.xml**: Build configuration files (Gradle or Maven).

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher
- [Maven/Gradle] (for dependency management and building the project)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unit-testing-repo.git
   cd unit-testing-repo
   ```

2. **Build the Project**

   For Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

   For Gradle:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. **Run the Tests**

   For Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

   For Gradle:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```

## Writing Tests

- **Test Classes**: Test classes should be placed in `src/test/java` and should mirror the package structure of the main application code.
- **Test Methods**: Each test method should be annotated with `@Test` and should contain logic to verify specific aspects of the application code.
- **Mocking**: Use [EasyMock/Mockito] to create mocks and set up expectations for testing.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example test using JUnit and EasyMock:

```java
import static org.easymock.EasyMock.*;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.Test;

public class MyServiceTest {

    @Test
    public void testServiceMethod() {
        MyDependency mockDependency = mock(MyDependency.class);
        expect(mockDependency.doWork()).andReturn("ExpectedResult");
        replay(mockDependency);

        MyService service = new MyService(mockDependency);
        String result = service.performAction();

        assertEquals("ExpectedResult", result);
        verify(mockDependency);
    }
}
```
